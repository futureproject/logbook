# IN SLACK BRANCH
- add sites and schools index to the api
  _ name
  _ schools
  _ enrollment
  _ ppl_engaged
  _ person_hrs
  _ ppl_w_projects
  _ projects

- add schools index to the api
- make site and schools (feeding the scope menu) use the API

- make project_participants polymorphic

- make a router
  - trigger dashboard view on default

redesign school pages
make national pages

restyle list pages
restyle profile pages

Use PJAX for most nav (or possibly just set up backbone, and set a layout header on nav menu?)
Make a Backbone view of the nav menu, ok?


ERRORS
- Auth is slow. Replace with auth from tfp-redirects, and simplify user model
- api/v1/engagements is timing out
- engagements per week graph is timing out

DATA
_ Build a yearly rake task for cleaning old student data
  - delete students with zero projects & engagements
  - move all students with grades to the next grade
  - deactivate all students with grades > 12

PHONEBOOK
_ create actual tab views, are you seriously reading data-attrs??
_ stop views from rendering when their controller is not active
_ make controllers inherit
_ Deleting a person association does not touch said person


_ Rework filters to be independent of scope_params

remove user site_id
make user school_id polymorphic
