- engagements per week graph is timing out

DATA
_ Build a yearly rake task for cleaning old student data
  - delete students with zero projects & engagements
  - move all students with grades to the next grade
  - deactivate all students with grades > 12

PHONEBOOK
_ create actual tab views, are you seriously reading data-attrs??
_ stop views from rendering when their controller is not active
_ make controllers inherit
_ Deleting a person association does not touch said person


_ Rework filters to be independent of scope_params

remove user site_id
make user school_id polymorphic
