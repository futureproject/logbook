_ make the Logged Hours Per Person graph a single series


ERRORS
- Auth is slow. Replace with auth from tfp-redirects
- simplify user model
- api/v1/engagements is timing out


PHONEBOOK

_ stop views from rendering when their controller is not active
_ make controllers inherit
_ Deleting a person association does not touch said person


_ Rework filters to be independent of scope_params

make user school_id polymorphic
