# DESIGN
_ make the Logged Hours Per Person graph a single series


ERRORS
- Auth is slow. Replace with auth from tfp-redirects
- simplify user model
- api/v1/engagements is timing out


PHONEBOOK
_ create actual tab views, are you seriously reading data-attrs??
_ stop views from rendering when their controller is not active
_ make controllers inherit
_ Deleting a person association does not touch said person


_ Rework filters to be independent of scope_params

remove user site_id
make user school_id polymorphic
