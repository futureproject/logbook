      Logbook
    .app-description

        Logbook helps you record what’s happening in your school. It’s also TFP’s only official record of the students, projects, and events in our universe.

        You must be online to load Logbook the first time. After that, it will work even when you have no internet connection. You also must have a school to use Logbook. If you’re a Chief Dream Director with no school, you can use a demo version of Logbook [here](http://os-staging.dream.org/).
