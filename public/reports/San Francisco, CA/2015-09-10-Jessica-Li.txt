What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 

The student activities fair was successful! Was able to collect students responses on what their dreams are.

Met more students and talked to people  who were involved in clubs at school.

Students are really interested in joining the dream team and they know what the future project is about more because of the fair. 

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 

Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared? 

N/A

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

I believe there are a lot of clubs at the school and students are just trying to figure out which ones to commit to, it would be great to have them all on a list with what times they meet!

A wellness check-up (Please answer each of the following questions): Are you getting "enough" sleep? Are you eating regularly? Are you spending quality time with your loved ones? Are you managing your finances well? Are you engaged in your emotional, spiritual, and/or physical practices regularly? Are you feeling intellectually and/or creatively stimulated?

I have not been taking care of myself this week on any of these questions! I need to do better.

Townhalls happen at 5:30PM on a Friday. If this time/day (or seeing the video afterward) isn't working for you and you were going to recommend another ideal day/time, when would you recommend we consider broadcasting?

What is your principal's name?
