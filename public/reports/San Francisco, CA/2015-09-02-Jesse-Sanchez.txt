What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights?
-Had an amazing 1-1 with Andres on Tuesday and seemed to make a lot of progress but there was minimal interaction the rest of the week :( I need to continue working on it! I also need to understand how important it is to have a follow up date and time set at the end of every session)
-Got to put up the Photos from Photobooth and got to loop in Ilcian. I owe him a burrito now. Great bonding opportunity
-The very first Dance Team meeting!! Great success and DM's leadership got a true test
-Anderson showed up and danced!! A small but productive conflict took place, good progress overall


What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?
-Daylenis is going through a rough time working through the fighting going on at home and she seemed out of her element
-Haven't seen Madeline and am concerned about how she is moving forward through her new life situation
-I felt a little overwhelmed regarding how I was performing and how to become better. I will learn from the feedback.

Do you feel like you are on track to complete the Launch Sequence on October 1st (possibility audit and plan, personal possibility audit, promises and proof points)? If not, what would make a difference for you?
It is hard for me to understand if I am on track or not. I think I am (?) I feel like a road map with timelines and attainable/tangible goals would be helpful in tracking my progress regarding how I am preparing for the Launch Sequence. I feel ready to take on this challenge!

Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared?
Are there timelines containing attainable goals that might be useful in regards to the lead up to the Launch Sequence?

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?
Help us facilitate the development of a Dream Director Handbook regarding timelines and markers and goals regarding the first few months.
