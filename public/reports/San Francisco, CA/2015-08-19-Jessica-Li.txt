What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights?

Students really love free food and they really enjoy free buttons. Students and staff were really excited that hot breakfast from Subway was provided by TFP. There definitely weren't 450 students the first day but I've noticed the ones that were here were dressing their best for the first day of school. I've noticed that students are more excited about the maroon TFP buttons, I'm really hoping to build school pride and spirit. 

All of the previous Dream Team Members, Angel, Jeremiah, Ricco all came by and were excited to start their future projects. They have come by almost everyday to say hello. They are persuading their friends to be on the Dream Team. 

There is a lot of collaboration happening with the different organizations at TMAHS. I have been able to connect with Wellness, Phoenix Scholars (Afterschool Program), Parent Liaison (in charge of the EL Club and PTSA), Youth Development Center (based out of Bayview/Hunter's Point), College Center (Lance with Counseling and Clarissa with SFCAC). I am in process of understanding the school better with different people who have been here. 


What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?

Getting into the politics of the school is a hard task. There are various district offices in the building and sometimes I hear teachers and students in the hallways asking questions about the spaces available here.

Student engagement here is very difficult, students do not get excited about a lot of things. They like things on some days and they dislike them on other days. It's hard to see what would engage them.  

Building relationships is a process and it will take some time to gain the trust of students and staff, snack help though!

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

Build more connections and try to sit in on a few actual classes, maybe extracurricular classes.

Did you complete the Integrity Survey? 

Filled this out during DD 101?

What thoughts did you have about "Most Likely to Succeed" after viewing it?

Did not view.

Do you have any questions that you would like addressed for next week's Town Hall (should impact the entire organization)?

N/A Thank you!

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights?

Being able to meet teachers and build relationships with staff was really helpful.

Seeing and cleaning the Dream Lab to get it ready for the students was challenging but well worth it!

Experiencing the professional development (PD) was informative on seeing the dynamics and pedagogy of staff.


What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?

There is still tape on the ceiling of the dream lab from painting it, I need to track down a latter.

Staff have an previous ideas of TFP, relationship building is a must!

There was no log in to the computer in the Dream Lab and I had to use my phone to do emails, etc.

There are so many people to interact with an not enough time to do it, maybe stop in during prep or free periods?
