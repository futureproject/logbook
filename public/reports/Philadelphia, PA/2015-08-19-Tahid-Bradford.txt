What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights?
 This weeks highlights were limited as I waited patiently to hear the decision regarding Paul Robeson. Monday's National Learning Day was a success, building and game planning with Shesheena, Shenille and Hakim proved to be beneficial. We decided on which city we are visiting for the first day and cleared up a few small misunderstandings regarding on boarding. This weeks Brightest moment was receiving confirmation that Paul Robeson would officially be my school, That I am officially a DREAM DIRECTOR, with a home!! The meeting with the Schools Principal and Counselor was excellent! They are excited about the opportunity to partner with TFP, and are willing participants in the fight that's aimed at leveraging regulated academic requirements with artistic expression; it seems to be a perfect fit. I am looking forward to next week and extremely anxious to begin designing and personalizing a space for the Paul Robeson Dream Team to operate!

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?
 Nothing stood out that seemed painful or bothersome this week. I am pleased with what was accomplished, individually and as a team, # APHILLYATED 

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?
Continuing to remain in integrity with updates and notifications.
