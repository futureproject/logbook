What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 
1) Coming back from my sabbatical only to learn that everything I needed done was done amazingly well in my absence between both my team and Shesheena who was filling in as my replacement. It felt great knowing that I could do something so profound and personal and be gone for over a week and yet come back to productivity and no problems, felt rather incredible.

2) In the Spring I met with staff at Paul Robeson HS but wasn't able to solidify a meeting with the principal due to his schedule. As of last week week (thanks to Shesheena and Tahid), Paul Robeson is officially confirmed as one of our partner schools.

3) My A.P. is pretty awesome and was super supportive filling me in on what I missed over the past couple of weeks. 

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?

Do you have friend or contact who is expecting follow up communication about a work opportunity with The Future Project? If so, what is their name, how you know them, and do you have any additional comments?

1) Nyoka Acevedo - my god sister
2) Saniiyah Bilal - met her at an event. She made it to the final round but did not get hired.

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week? Any questions for the Town Hall?
