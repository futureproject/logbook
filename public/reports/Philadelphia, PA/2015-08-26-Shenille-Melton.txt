Weekly Report (Due 8/28)

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 
Submitting my budget and receiving my Amex card.
Talking to Erin to confirm my on boarding has taken place.
Finding a painter to paint a section of the wall in my school.
Finding prime real estate (wall space) for the painter to paint in the school.

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 
There's a whole bunch of stuff in my classroom that was left by a previous partner of South Philly High. They were not prepared for me to move into the space because her stuff is there. They contacted her on Thursday to see if she is planning to come and get it. I will follow up with them Monday, so that I know how to move forward next week. Some of the stuff will come in handy for me to use if she chooses not to pick it up, so this may turn into a bright spot.

Do you have friend or contact who is expecting follow up communication about a work opportunity with The Future Project? If so, what is their name, how you know them, and do you have any additional comments?
I will be following up with Kira to confirm our meeting at the school on Tuesday at 10:30a. She is the artist who will be painting the wall and she needs to see the space and take measurements. She provided original paintings for me to use in the documentary I shot last year.

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week? Any questions for the Town Hall?
No improvements to note. No town hall questions.
