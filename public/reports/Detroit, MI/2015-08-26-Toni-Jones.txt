What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 
N/A
Do you have friend or contact who is expecting follow up communication about a work opportunity with The Future Project? If so, what is their name, how you know them, and do you have any additional comments?
I would only suggest communication with Kalah Springer, she was one of our fellow dream directors and she spoke with me about her departure  being a bitter situation. She was very sweet about it all but she did feel neglected, disregarded and insignificant to/by the organization. 

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week? Any questions for the Town Hall? N/A
