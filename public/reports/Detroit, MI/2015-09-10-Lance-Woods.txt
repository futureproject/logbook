Weekly Report (Due 9/11)

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? Moments that stood out is that I was able to meet all three prinicpals in Cody. Things went well... they are with open arms for TFP.

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? Pain pots are that I wasn't able to meet the Principal at CMA yet. I was able to meet students on the Dream Team at CMA. They aren't all that excited about The Future Project and are very upset with how things have been lately. This is a huge area to improve, but I don't know how effective it will be, being that I will only be able to spend 2 days max at each school. 

Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared? Will the Detroit model be shared across the nation so that the rest of the team will know each dream director is in multiple schools? 

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week? N/A

A wellness check-up (Please answer each of the following questions): Are you getting "enough" sleep? Are you eating regularly? Are you spending quality time with your loved ones? Are you managing your finances well? Are you engaged in your emotional, spiritual, and/or physical practices regularly? Are you feeling intellectually and/or creatively stimulated? Yes to all questions

Townhalls happen at 5:30PM on a Friday. If this time/day (or seeing the video afterward) isn't working for you and you were going to recommend another ideal day/time, when would you recommend we consider broadcasting? This works fine.

What is your principal's name? I have 4 principals. Cody APL- Jonathan Matthews, Cody DIT- Latoya Hall-King, Cody MCH- Michelle Parker, | CMA- Donya Odom
