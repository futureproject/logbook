What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 

I entered my school this week! My administration gave me a full size classroom as well as an office within the counseling center. They said that I impacted the school last year so much that they wanted me to have a bigger space.

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 

There is still some concerns over the Detroit Model that needs to be addressed

Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared? 
No

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

I will continue to say that we have to make people to commit to our chain of command in terms of communication and problem solving 


A wellness check-up (Please answer each of the following questions): Are you getting "enough" sleep? Are you eating regularly? Are you spending quality time with your loved ones? Are you managing your finances well? Are you engaged in your emotional, spiritual, and/or physical practices regularly? Are you feeling intellectually and/or creatively stimulated?

I am an Insomniac so I always have issues sleeping...lol. Yes to everything else on the list.

Townhalls happen at 5:30PM on a Friday. If this time/day (or seeing the video afterward) isn't working for you and you were going to recommend another ideal day/time, when would you recommend we consider broadcasting? 
I would say ideally the best time would be during our National Learning Days. As most of the field is already committed to online and group learning.


What is your principal's name?

Principal: Berry Greer
