What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 
1. Greeting the students at Renaissance as they entered the school with hugs and their hottest jams playing in the background. 
2. Meeting with Principal Williams and her assistant about creating momentum and school pride this year. 
3. Greeting students and congratulating them on their first week completed at DSA

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 
1. I really need to manage my time or more so educate myself on what time management looks like in my real time living. 
2. Realizing that its is going to be a challenged to Dream Direct two that have had a Dream Director because both student populations expect personal interaction and strong presence of their Dream Director. So for me it feels like I have two husbands, I honestly don't know how I am going to do this. 
3. Create a schedule for myself where I can magnate my professional and personal tasks and interests. 

Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared? NO

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week? 
I THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A SERIOUS EVALUATION WITH HOW WE RECRUIT DD AS A ORGANIZATION. I HAVE FOUND THAT MANY SOCIAL JUSTICE CONSCIOUS INDIVIDUALS HERE IN DETROIT DONT HAVE THE LANGUAGE OR CULTURE OF FUTURE PROJECT AND DREAMS. THEY TEND TO HAVE A LANGUAGE AND AWARENESS OF PROBLEMS, POTENTIAL ISSUES AND WHAT WILL MAKE THEM FEEL INFERIOR OR SILENCED. NOTHING IN PARTICULAR IS WRONG WITH THAT, BUT THAT TYPE OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND MINDSET DOESNT ALIGN WITH THE FUTURE PROJECT AND OUR CULTURE AROUND DREAMS, PASSION, PURPOSE AND POWER. ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO RALLYS, ADVOCACY, PROTEST, COMMUNITY ACTIVISM WOULDL BE A BETTER FIT FOR THEM. THEREFORE I THINK WE AS AN ORGANIZATION WOULD BE 10% BETTER IS IF WE EVALUATE HOW WE RECRUIT AND PUT IN A BASIC JOB DESCRIPTION OF A DREAM DIRECTOR.
