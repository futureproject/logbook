What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 

- This week TFP Newark launched in schools, which was amazing to say the least.  Every cafeteria had a DJ present playing upbeat music as students entered.  Almost all schools created a Photo Booth for staff and students to take pictures.  At East Side there was candy spread out across the tables and smoothies near the DJ booth for the taking.  At Shabazz the music played in the background as students dress up in stylish clothes with their dream director.  The West Side launch went so well the Principal requested that Tracee relaunch on Tuesday in order for more students to experience it (first day attendance was low).  At Central, Carlos facilitated workshops for over 200 students in the auditorium.  He began with a video on black lives matters then moved in to a Q and A, which required student participation in multiple ways.  Some students responded to questions, others created questions and held them up at the front of the auditorium on large chart paper.  Though Merit prep. launched about a week ago,  Emma was hard at work TFP'ifying the bulletin boards around the building.  

- The Weequahic launch was special and deserves its own bullet.  As you may or may not know, all students within the Newark Public school system must travel through a medal detector before entering the school building.  Chopp felt that this experience could be so much better and decided to do something about it.  Chopp decorated the metal detector and as students traveled though it they were crowned and told that they were kings/queens.  As this was happening the Mayor of Newark stopped by for a school visit.  As he traveled through the metal detector he was also crowned. It was a beautiful thing! 

- Over the past few weeks I have met with Rutgers Newark in order to establish a partnership between the school district and the University on a variety of initiatives.  This week we were invited to the University club/activity fair and we were the main attraction.  We signed up over 150 mentors to support our efforts at West Side.  Moreover, the Dean of student life agreed to provide us with 10 paid undergrad/graduate students to be mentors at West Side.  

- We are also working with the Dean of admissions at Rutgers and were able to establish the following:
              - After meeting with NPS I was able to secure a luncheon, which requires all high school guidance counselors to attend and learn about scholarship opportunities for NPS students, how Rutgers is rethinking honors, and ensuring guidance counselors know what to submit, when to submit it, and who to submit it to.  
              - We have secured space at Rutgers the first Friday of every month to bring 50 students on campus to participate in a networking event, facilitated by TFP, with Rutgers students and staff.  The university is also proving food for the students.


What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 

- Found out I was utilizing the wrong link for weekly reports.
 

Do you feel like you are on track to complete the Launch Sequence on October 1st (possibility audit and plan, personal possibility audit, promises and proof points)? If not, what would make a difference for you? 

Yes, I am on track to complete my promises and proof points by October 1.

Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared?

No, I was able to share out during the town hall this past Friday.

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

Continue with the momentum built up from the DC summit around core values, integrity, and transparency.  Plan as far ahead as possible in order to avoid making promises to outside stakeholders that require quick turnaround from TFP (this affects our ability to put our best foot forward).
