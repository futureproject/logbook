What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 

1. My principal meeting with my chief! It went well and I am excited to be in partnership with the school :)
2. Purchasing more crowns for my launch and visualizing what it will be like to spread the message of, "You are Royal" to my students!
3. Having conversations with various folks in my community about creating partnerships to expose the students at Weequahic to new worlds!

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 

1. Getting my Weekly Report/Expense Reports in late :(
2. Feeling a tad bit nervous about attending and leading an ice breaker at my PD this week.
3. Managing all the partnerships I want to build for this school year. 

Do you have friend or contact who is expecting follow up communication about a work opportunity with The Future Project? If so, what is their name, how you know them, and do you have any additional comments?

Yes, Jenna Dorce, she is a dear friend and colleague in the start up of a non profit. Jenna would be an excellent addition to The Future Project, and has been an apprentice in the past year who spent a lot of time enhancing the apprentice experience for our Newark/New York team. I would love to see Jenna get a fair chance at interviewing for employment at TFP.

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week? Any questions for the Town Hall?

Keep smiling!!!
