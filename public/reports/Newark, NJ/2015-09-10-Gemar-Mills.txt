What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 

- Our time in Philly was amazing.  Everyone welcomed us with open arms and we were able to execute our task.  The principal tasked us with schedule distribution.  We were able to create a structure that allowed students to obtain their schedule within 1-2 minutes and head to their Advisory class.  We then moved our operation to the cafeteria, setup dream boards, and an information station.  As students arrived for lunch they received the follwing:

- TFP buttons
- TFP Flyers
- Candy 

In exchange for their dreams, which were written on the dream boards posted on the walls.  

- TFP Newark took a trip to Philly at 5am in morning.  It was a great bonding experience to say the least.  Zaki traveled the night before in his own car in order to support Taheed in pulling off an amazing first day launch.  Everyone was committed to seeing TFP put our best foot forward.

- We wrapped up in schools around 2 and had a late lunch at the Cheesecake Factory.  During lunch everyone had 1 minute to share out.  The things that were stated really made us feel appreciated:

        -Shantrelle - "I have never felt this supported since working for TFP, Thank you!"
          -    Hakeem was nearly in tears as he shared - "My mother was there to help me with launch.  It feels so good to let the children from my hood and my city know that their dreams are possible".


What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 

 - When life hits everything else takes a backseat.  I often have a good balance of personal and professional.  However, God is totally testing me.  My personal life has been interesting the past 2 months, which affects my work.  

- I must be more explicit in my communication. A few times this week I found myself dealing with the result of team members not having clarity.


Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared? 

No.

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

Continue with the momentum built up from the DC summit around core values, integrity, and transparency.  Plan as far ahead as possible in order to avoid making promises to outside stakeholders that require quick turnaround from TFP (this affects our ability to put our best foot forward).
