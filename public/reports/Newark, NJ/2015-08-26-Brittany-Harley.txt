What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 
1. Being in communication with my principal around the first day experience and also assisting him in creating an experience for the teachers on the first day of professional development.
2. Finding and securing DJ equipment so that a student alum of MXS can DJ for the first day of school.
3. During our National Learning Day, I ran into a MXS student at Merit Prep and informed him that I'd be the new Dream Director and asked him for feedback on my ideas for the first day back experience. He got extremely excited and that got me even more excited for the first day launch.

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 
1. An area to improve would be around organization with documents and daily to do lists. 
2. Dealing with a personal health issue was a pain point this week. 
3. An area to improve would be to check in with my team when I need support.
