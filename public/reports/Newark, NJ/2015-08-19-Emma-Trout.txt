Weekly Report (Due 8/21)
---

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights?
- Meeting my staff at Merit Prep
- Getting permission to do a Zumba class for the staff next week
- Planning for the student/parent BBQ with the staff
- First NLD with my amazing Newark team! 
- Starting my possibility audit! 
- The first school I've ever worked at that doesn't have metal detectors! 

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?
- Similar curriculum as when I first started teaching in Detroit (same trainers even) and it makes me nervous because of the struggles that my students experienced then
- Not being at the first PD which made it difficult to learn everyones first names and to get to know them well, luckily I did a round table shift through the week and know everyone now
- No face time with the principal yet 1:1 will ask for that after PD on Tuesday. 

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?
Whats going on across the team? I would love to know more about the movement retreat. Could people share out/post pictures of different NLDs they still feel very much like they are happening alone! 

Did you complete the Integrity Survey? 
Yes

What thoughts did you have about "Most Likely to Succeed" after viewing it?
- Why aren't we creating schools now that we have learned all of this from the making of this documentary? Is there a conversation going on about that?
- What would it really look like for their to be a total make over of our education system? How do we start that process?
- Can we visit High Tech High? Do they want a Dream Director? Think of what is possible there with all of those materials and teachers who want to support that process! 

Do you have any questions that you would like addressed for next week's Town Hall (should impact the entire organization)?
Nope!
