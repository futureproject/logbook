What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights?
1. The first National Learning Day was awesome. It was great being with my city team. Also, seeing other Dream Directors from across the country during Studio time brought me back to the bonds I created. 
2.  I had my second meeting with Principal Holmes on 8/19/2015. I am excited to get to know him more. He is excited to have me as the Dream Director. It was awesome listening to him share about goals he has set for the year and his plan to help integrate TFP deeper into the Bulldog community.
3. At the start of our meeting, Principal Holmes shared with me that he shared with DT member, Latifah Hinds that I would be the Dream Director this year at MXS and that she was bubbling with excitement. This made me extremely happy.

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?
1. An area to improve in is having complete confidence in knowing when to step up and step back.
2. A pain point this week was attending orientation at MXS on 8/19/2015 and only two students and three parents be present.
3. An area to improve in is documentation and follow-up.
