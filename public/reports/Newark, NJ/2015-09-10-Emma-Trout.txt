What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights?
- Coaching Session with Arnaysha: student who got in trouble was brought to me and I had the chance to really talk to her about what she wanted. She sees herself as a leader and we developed a plan for her to become a positive leader of the 7th grade. 
- First Full day of school!- Our first full day started on Tuesday and it was so exciting to see the students transition classes, I got to be in every lunch period, hang out with them and interact with the entire school. 
- Solidified time of a daily course for the freshmen! Every morning from 8:18-8:48 I will be doing a freshmen seminar with the entire freshmen class. I have been in communication with the teachers and we will be facilitating together! 
- Teacher appreciation event for all students: There was a weird energy in the building on friday so we found a way to make it more energetic and exciting. 

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 
- Lack of communication from the administration- there hasn't been any real communication from the administration about needs or expectations except that they wanted some art projects done around the school, I would like more communications with how I can support their vision
- Tension with the Dean of Culture: He doesn't seem to love my presence in the lunch room because I want to interact with the students and not just make them be quiet. I want to make sure that his vision doesn't get fogged by my interaction but I also don't want to support systems that treat children like they are in jail. 
- Still haven't gotten the artwork done at my school, would love to have an update on that from Zaki or Brit. 

Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared? 
- When do our interns start school? It would be nice if we could make videos for them or bombard their inboxes with emails full of love/phones full of texts full of love. 
- I want to hear more stories about the beginning years at TFP, for our birthday celebration can we hear more about some of the flops and amazing outcomes that happened in year 1 and 2! 

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?
- We should write a history of TFP so that new members know some of the institutionalized knowledge. 
-I really loved sharing with the DD201 group when we accomplished a part of our goals that are external to work. It would be great if we could do that team wide somehow! 

A wellness check-up (Please answer each of the following questions): Are you getting "enough" sleep? Are you eating regularly? Are you spending quality time with your loved ones? Are you managing your finances well? Are you engaged in your emotional, spiritual, and/or physical practices regularly? Are you feeling intellectually and/or creatively stimulated?
I'm getting enough sleep.
I wish I had an accountability partner to support me in eating better.
I need to see my friends and make new ones here, I have been very work focused. 
Finances are fine. 
I need to run, again an AP would be helpful in this. 
I could use more creativity in my life, more intellectual challenges. 

Townhalls happen at 5:30PM on a Friday. If this time/day (or seeing the video afterward) isn't working for you and you were going to recommend another ideal day/time, when would you recommend we consider broadcasting?
It is a difficult time to see the video, and I often forget to watch the video afterwards, maybe CDDs could be a reminder in the dashboard, OR we could post it to the private Facebook group so that we know exactly where it is and have a reminder. 

Wednesdays would be a great day, in the afternoon, like 4:30, however that is in the middle of some peoples day. 

What is your principal's name?
Mr. Ron Harvey
