As a Future Project staff member, it is crucial that we live the principles we teach and foster in others.  As we serve others in living the life of a Dreamer, it is our responsibility to ensure that we are demonstrating the behaviors and mindset we wish to see.  

Many people have not thought deeply about what success means for them.  Often, we use other people’s definitions for ourselves – whether it matches what we value or not.  How do you define success and is that different for various aspects for your life?  If so, explain how the definition changes. 

For me there are two types of success personal and professional.  Personal success embodies the things that are not of the material world such as the love of family, friends, and your health.  Professional success embodies the things that are of the material world such as the amount of money one attains, the amount of notoriety one gains, and legacy he or she leaves behind.     
     

It is integral that we take care of ourselves physically, emotionally, financially, mentally and spiritually. What are you doing to care for yourself in the areas of body, heart, material well-being, mind and spirit, and creating the life of your dreams?
  
The things that I am doing to care for the various areas of my life consist of the following:

- I have taken on a spiritual challenge in which I look into the mirror everyday and say a prayer to myself.
- Each morning I wake up at 4am in the morning in order to get to the gym by 5am and workout for 2 hours.
- I no longer eat meat or poultry and I have not consumed bread, rice, or pasta for the past 3 months.
- I read often, I just finished reading Oprah Winfrey's book "What I Know for sure".  I recently purchased "Mindset" by Carol Dweck however I have yet to begin reading it.
- I typically work 12-15 hour work days in order to reach the professional goals I have set out to achieve each day, month, year.  This usually yields material success.   


Our team assists many people in actualizing their dreams due, in large part, to their knowledge of many people, places, resources/tools and ideas. What do you read and/or watch daily or weekly to educate you or peak your ongoing curiosity?  What workshops, seminars, conferences and summits are you excited about attending to help you grow as a Dreamer?  

- I have been signed up for landmark training and will begin the process on September 25.
- The last 3 books I have read were:
                      - "The Alchemist"
                       - "What I know for sure"
                       - "The Mis-Education of the Negro" (reread, I really love this book)
- On a daily bases I go on facebook and instragram both of which peak my ongoing curiosity.  Some of my most resent interesting finds were:

                  - Shark Island - Germany's first holocaust
                 -  The United Nations is planning to launch a "New Universal Agenda" for humanity"
                 -   Democrats for Education Reform Announces Shavar Jefferies as national president (He will be mentoring at West Side)
 
       
Without systems and practices around your planning and execution, it is easy for things to fall through the cracks.  What is your ritual or routine around To Do Lists, email, voicemail, and tracking finances?

My ritual is pretty straight forward.  Complete all task that you commit to.  I open the email then I commit to reading it.  If the email requires a response I try to do so within 24 hours.  If it requires some followup I do so within 24 hours.  I do not normally listen to voicemail.  If I have more than 5 task on my "To Do List" I write them down and cross them out as I complete them.  Everyday, review my finances through multiple cellphone apps.
    


We often find ourselves struggling with the same challenges over years and years.  What is ongoingly out of integrity in your life?

- Time with my love ones.


No one can do the work of transforming an entire nation of Dreamers alone.   Who is on your team, available to you when you need their support – within and/or outside of the TFP community? 

It is to many people to name however I have a host of educators, family members, friends, and politicians how have consistently delivered on promises that they made to me.  



Since we are about the business of making dreams come true and helping others develop the skills to do so over and over, it is important that we are always actively engaged in creating the life we’ve dreamed of. Considering your answers to questions 1-6 above and any and all goals you’ve set for yourself outside of this document, which big dream, goal, or aspiration do you intend to actualize by the end of Summer 2016? 

- I am going to finish my dissertation and graduate from Seton Hall University a doctor of education. 

No one comes to the role of Chief Dream Director with mastery in all aspects of the job. There are many things needed to do the job well - 1:1 coaching, observation, facilitation, serving as a change leader within a city, and managing various administrative accountabilities. Given that we are committed to growth, in what aspects of this role would you most like to explore, practice, or get better at doing?

- I think that I can grow in all areas of the position thus would like to explore each category equally.
