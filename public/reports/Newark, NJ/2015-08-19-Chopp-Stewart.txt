What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights?

1. National Learning Day and the studio time in particular was joyous to see everyone!
2. Watching, "Most Likely To Succeed"
3. Outlining my entire year to include themes for each month!

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?

1. Still not having word on when my Principal meeting would be.
2. Not having any clarity on what exactly score cards are.
3. I am unable to make purchases for my launch and as a result feel a bit stalled in fully planning for it.

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

Making sure that when docs are shared there is an email that states that they are being shared and what is expected. In addition, when calendar invites are sent out that we are told what the invite is for, in all cases :)

Did you complete the Integrity Survey?

No, I will be doing that as soon as I submit this.

What thoughts did you have about "Most Likely to Succeed" after viewing it?

I want to attend High Tech High!!! In addition, I would love to include parts of the scientific method in the creation of projects. 

Do you have any questions that you would like addressed for next week's Town Hall (should impact the entire organization)?

I would like to kindly ask, when we will receive our launch money?
