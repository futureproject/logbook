Weekly Report (Due 9/4)

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 

-Finally getting concrete info around the first 3 days of school
-Getting my own office!!!!
-The Dream Team cleaning and organizing the entire office with me :)!
-Seeing 2 graduated Dream Team members who I adore
-Meeting with MKG/admin/Dream Team to discuss possibilities for the big space transformation project this fall at Hudson!
-Buying silly hats at Party City for teachers to wear on the first day

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 

-Communication between facilities & custodial staff & administration is often broken in my building, so I need to be mindful about how and to whom I ask certain logistical questions/make requests
-The dead roaches and thin film of dirt that covered the entire office I just moved into
-No other teachers at my school were able to make it to the StoryCorps training to complete the curriculum overview -- this poses a challenge as it puts the integrity of the program at risk. Even though I'm not teaching the program, I need to follow up with Nancy (who has not been responding to our StoryCorps POC) about how things will go down/how to make up the training

Do you feel like you are on track to complete the Launch Sequence on October 1st (possibility audit and plan, personal possibility audit, promises and proof points)? If not, what would make a difference for you?

We have not talked about the personal possibility audit at all in our National Learning days (since dd 201), and if possible, I would greatly appreciate some time in upcoming sessions to actually work on getting these complete (vs. *talking* about way to get these complete). It might also be cool to share or collaborate creative ways for our students to help us get some of the information (Possibility audit) as a studio!

Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared?

Nope.

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

n/a
