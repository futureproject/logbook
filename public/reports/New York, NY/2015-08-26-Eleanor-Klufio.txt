What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 
-- Watching/Experiencing Kleaver being dynamic in the role of Chief.  He demonstrates great balance and control with the NLD experience that allows his teammates to feel good and enjoy the process.
-- Making my first purchase for the school year
-- Designing stickers for my school's launch.

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 
The NLD felt too long.  Being in one place from 9:45 to 6pm is a long day that does make me feel creative by the time we reach "studio".

Do you have friend or contact who is expecting follow up communication about a work opportunity with The Future Project? If so, what is their name, how you know them, and do you have any additional comments?
Yes.  An individual named Geoffrey Ratliff reached out to me saying he applied to a few positions and hadn't heard back (this was a few weeks ago.)  He reached out to me because he is the friend of a friend of mine who indicated that I work for TFP, I do not know him personally. 

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week? Any questions for the Town Hall?
Provide DD's software like photoshop/illustrator.  Hire a citywide Photographer/Videographer.
