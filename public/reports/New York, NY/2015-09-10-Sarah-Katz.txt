Weekly Report (Due 9/11)

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 

-Seeing a whole bunch of the "cool" kids put on silly hats and take photos at our first day photo-booth
-Watching returning members of the DT greet, shake hands, make introductions and take photos with new students/freshmen 
-BUBBLES (enough said)
-Watching the Dream Team step into more leadership by beginning to brainstorm and plan for their kick-off event next week (which they will be running)
-Running around to every advisory dressed like a random superhero for mini-intros and snack distribution
-Seeing all of the amazing work and ideas of my NYC teammates in our group chat this week! I am always inspired by what they are doing and how they are doing it. 

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 

-The schedule this week was rough for students (they were in their advisories/in the same room ALL DAY Wednesday and Thursday), and I wish I could have been included in the creation of that scheduling/programming this summer as I think I could have brought something to the table (all of those decisions were made by the leadership team)
-I am still unclear about my concentration, about promises and proof points, and about certain logbook entries. I'll be sure to address these things at our next meeting, but the Possibility Audit is due in 2 weeks so I'm a bit confused about expectations there!
-I've already spent a bunch of my September budget -- gotta be scrappy these next few weeks!
-As I attempt to charge my DT with more responsibility this year, I am already feeling how hard it is to let go of some control/direction/expectations as we begin creating things! This is so important though! Looking forward to this transition.

Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared? 

Nope!

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

n/a

A wellness check-up (Please answer each of the following questions): Are you getting "enough" sleep? Are you eating regularly? Are you spending quality time with your loved ones? Are you managing your finances well? Are you engaged in your emotional, spiritual, and/or physical practices regularly? Are you feeling intellectually and/or creatively stimulated?

NOPE :(. I have been sick all week (same as last year!), and am remembering just how challenging the reality of being in school is (especially as things kick off) when it comes to prioritizing health and wellness and basic bodily needs (aka you forget to pee for like 6 hours).

Townhalls happen at 5:30PM on a Friday. If this time/day (or seeing the video afterward) isn't working for you and you were going to recommend another ideal day/time, when would you recommend we consider broadcasting?

I don't know.

What is your principal's name?

Nancy Amling.
