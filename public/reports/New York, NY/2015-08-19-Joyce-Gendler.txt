What thoughts did you have about "Most Likely to Succeed" after viewing it?

I loved it. I was reminded of how important failing and trying again is to create long-term learning, that was a common thread that I saw in all of the learning experiences of the students in there - sometimes I try to not let my students fail, but maybe that's sort of exactly what they need, so that we can provide tools to build resilience and confidence in building something without guarantee of success.

Do you have any questions that you would like addressed for next week's Town Hall (should impact the entire organization)?
