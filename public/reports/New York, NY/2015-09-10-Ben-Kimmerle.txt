Weekly Report (Due 9/11)

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 

   -   Joining William Yusah's classes (Theater and Literacy & Advanced Theater) and watching him work his magic (he is basically a Dream Director without the title!) and getting to participate with students
   - Having a conversation with a teacher (Lina Mai) and ending up co-teaching her introduction activities with her in her next period Toxicology Class
   - Being called "Mr. Dream", the "Dream Guy", and myriad other hodge-podge names by students around school
   - Having engaging, encouraging discussions with students who are already ready to chase their projects
   - Feeling that I am able to show up and do my job just being 100% authentic and having freedom to help students be the same, in whatever ways possible.

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 

   - Not understanding technology (Wi-fi, e-mails, etc.) or basic school functions (supplies, teachers room, etc.)
   - Not having structures set up to begin working with students who are ready to take action; lack of planning of how I want to create and utilize my Dream Team
   - NYC DOE internet blocking almost every site I needed (including logbook.dream.org!)

Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared? 

   - Can we get tickets to Andrew's TED Talk?

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

   - Create a virtual library to catalog the best of our teams: "Books" of ice breakers, full campaign plans. templates of letters/e-mails to teachers/students/families, lesson ideas, etc. 
   - A way for us to alter the organization of amazing people outside of the organization who are dream directing in the world so they can be brought in/talked to in order to further our work
   - More partnerships with companies! The Thrive collaboration looks AWESOME (haven't bought yet, but have explored!) and I appreciate the work to create that. More connections and discounts (school supplies, designers, equipment, magazine subscriptions, bookstores) would make our jobs that much more impactful and help us stretch our budgets.
   - Some of the templates on brand.thefutureproject.org won't download (Comic 2x3 and Comic 2.5x8, and others)

A wellness check-up (Please answer each of the following questions): Are you getting "enough" sleep? Are you eating regularly? Are you spending quality time with your loved ones? Are you managing your finances well? Are you engaged in your emotional, spiritual, and/or physical practices regularly? Are you feeling intellectually and/or creatively stimulated?

   - The start of school has made adequate sleep a little tough (anxious, up early, getting into a schedule, feeling drained), and the school day has made eating less regular/structured than in days prior. But I'm still getting to the gym (my "temple")! I feel very intellectually/creatively stimulated, and maybe a little over-stimulated as I try to reign in all the ideas and possibilities for the coming year.

Townhalls happen at 5:30PM on a Friday. If this time/day (or seeing the video afterward) isn't working for you and you were going to recommend another ideal day/time, when would you recommend we consider broadcasting?

   - The videos afterward are nice, but 5:30p on Fridays is a little tough because it's well after school and I am not always at a computer at that time.

What is your principal's name?
