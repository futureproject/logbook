What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 

1) I didn't get to see my team for National Learning Day, as I was in New Orleans for a faith leaders retreat with the Samuel Dewitt Proctor Conference.

Do you have friend or contact who is expecting follow up communication about a work opportunity with The Future Project? If so, what is their name, how you know them, and do you have any additional comments?

N/A

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week? Any questions for the Town Hall?

Is it possible for Logbook to have B/I/U or even bulletpoint functions? I know, for me, that would help organize thoughts.
