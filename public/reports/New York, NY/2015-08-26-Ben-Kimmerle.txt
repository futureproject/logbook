   - Discussion @ National Learning Day around building a policy-change movement in NYC
   - Meeting with principal & hearing about his personal cultural questioning/decisions

   - Meeting with Mica to discuss ways to capture data at NEST+m this year

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 
  
   - Disjointed Studio time 
   - Long National Learning Day
   - The delay in discussing HR checklist (some of the items, if they hadn't been ironed out at this point would be in pretty critical condition)

Do you have friend or contact who is expecting follow up communication about a work opportunity with The Future Project? If so, what is their name, how you know them, and do you have any additional comments?

   - Mica Gutierrez, "teamio" at TFP, started work this week but doesn't have info about her role

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week? Any questions for the Town Hall?

   - Create a single page (go.dream.org/directory?) where all the "go.dream.org" sites and other resources (brand.thefutureproject.org) are listed for easy access/reference
