Weekly Report (Due 8/21)
---

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights?
- Meeting with AP Josh Gold, hearing his history of the school, a bit of his personal story, and seeing him play basketball (really well) with the summer camp counselors
- Watching "Most Likely to Succeed"
- Connecting with the team on Monday and just feeling the zestiness again!
- Bracelet from Dave Noodlez/Stereotype Co.
- Finalizing budget for launch/September

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?
- Principal was out, so it has been hard to understand the orientation and first-day activities (and thus hard to plan)
- Scrutinizing over budget submission
- No AmEx card or business cards

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?
- More support for new DD's about their plans for launch/starting school and helping them to think through what and why

Did you complete the Integrity Survey? 
- YES

What thoughts did you have about "Most Likely to Succeed" after viewing it?
- It is an incredible approach to education and I really want to learn more about the school model and how I can bring aspects of that into NEST+m. I am interested at the caliber of students who come into the school and what their abilities are before even starting school. It seems like the model would have to rely on some basic proficiencies in order to push students to operate with that much autonomy. The approach seems very much like a TFP-applied-to-academics model. I would like to go visit the school and spend time observing/hearing from teachers, or explore some of their graduate-level opportunities. 

Do you have any questions that you would like addressed for next week's Town Hall (should impact the entire organization)?
- Are there any updates about the sexual harassment allegations addressed at the DC Summit?
- Why are DD's going into schools without MOUs signed?
- How has SF & DC been doing?!
