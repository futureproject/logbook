Weekly Report (Due 9/4)

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 
  - Getting to be present and introduce myself at high school orientations
  - Meeting a few teachers who seem to be interested in my work
  - Meeting my office-mate and talking/connecting about our mutual fitness interest & how to bring it to school
  - Meeting one of Alex Colby's friends who is a theater teacher and in love with TFP (and a huge ally/advocate)!

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 
   - Traveling to, and helping out in, New Haven was nice, but I didn't feel super-utilized and it didn't seem like a great ROI for me or Frank
   - Initial introductions to students were hard as they were trying to get their schedules, lockers, and get home
   
Do you feel like you are on track to complete the Launch Sequence on October 1st (possibility audit and plan, personal possibility audit, promises and proof points)? If not, what would make a difference for you?

   - School has not started yet so some of this information (or the context to create it) is hard to collect. Honestly, my focus has been on prepping for orientation and the beginning of school and I haven't taken too much time to develop these items.


Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared?
   - No!

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

   - Improve the process to remedy the accidental use of AmEx cards for personal expenses.
   - Create a different "notes" section for each person added to Logbook where we can input interests, birthdays, etc. I know there is a Notes section already, but it seems like this is more for notes on progress (which will change) versus constants about the student (they're interested in skateboarding, live in UES, play guitar, etc.).


A FEW QUESTIONS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR US TO MAKE TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS FOR YOU...

1. Do you have special dietary needs or restrictions we should be aware of for when food is being ordered for the team?
   - No

2. What is your preferred departure airport?
   - JFK 

3. Are  there cities where you would not need lodging/accommodations because you have family or friends to stay with?
   - Possibly DC, San Francisco, and New Haven, depending on friend availability and distance to events.

4. Do you have a spouse or children? We want to be mindful of family commitments whenever possible.
   - No, but I would appreciate significant others (especially those who live together) to be considered along with "spouses". My "family" may not look the same as a spouse/child setup, but it is still really important!
