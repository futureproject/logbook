What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights?

1) Went to an education networking event with Ben K on Wednesday and met a lady that teaches students how to do Archery and thought that would be a cool opportunity to expose out students to and build some comrade so we'll be in touch with her.

2) Really enjoyed watching the "Most Likely to Succeed" documentary it was pretty cool. 

3)  Starting connecting with some students about next weeks dream team aka facilitated learning experience. 

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?

1) One of my graduates that I need to get paperwork from in order to move the MSNBC story forward is not responding to my texts and we need the paperwork in order for the story to come out. 

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

I thought were removing this question or least the NYC team requested that it be removed it kind of weird questions to respond to and I never answered it anyway.  

Did you complete the Integrity Survey?  

yes 

What thoughts did you have about "Most Likely to Succeed" after viewing it?  

I personally enjoyed it and I also think that the idea of project based learning is necessary and really does allow us to create the space in our schools.  It seems like some of the NYC team before or after the SF summit would like to take a trip to the High Tech High to check it out in person so that's how excited we were about watching it. 

Do you have any questions that you would like addressed for next week's Town Hall (should impact the entire organization)?
My only questions is about wage works and you mentioned that its going away meaning that we'll be paying for the metro cards directly from our own debit cards now instead of coming out of our paychecks?  I wasn't sure what that meant.  Thanks!
