What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights?

- Connecting with Jess Palermo from MKG (one of our corporate partners) to discuss the company's space transformation project they're going to do this fall at Hudson! #soexcited
- Meeting with Principal Amling to discuss updates to our TFP model (3 C's, 4 P's), ideas for the new year, and committing to and cultivating a Culture of YES at Hudson. Also watching her go through Sallome's TFP yearbook, giving her an "I exist in a place of YES" shirt, and hearing her say that she would pay to have my full-time if our funding went away! #cries
- Phone meeting with Liz Rivera (the community associate at Landmark HS) and Liz Alexander (the creator of "Girl Magic") to begin collaboration around special programming for the young women in our schools this year! #bebrave


What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?

- Not having money on the AMEX is really frustrating -- especially when items are needed for the first day of school that have longer time windows for shipping
-Paying for my returning DT members' shirts out of pocket :(
- Not having metro cards for my students who I'm meeting with this Saturday :(

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

-I don't think the National Learning Day was necessarily the *best* use of our time this week -- I would have liked to spend more time actually curating/creating tools and plans and materials for the first day/week/month. I also think we can and should use time at the next one to start filling out our Possibility Audit (there is a lot of info we can find independently), so we feel on top of it upon entering school!

Did you complete the Integrity Survey? 

-Yes

What thoughts did you have about "Most Likely to Succeed" after viewing it?

It definitely felt like an advertising/campaign tool. I saw the general connection to TFP, but only at a very high-level. The stories being told didn't feel student-centric (they followed only 2 or 3 young people specifically), which was disappointing. There were other glaring issues (for example, almost every consulted expert was a white man/white dudes were talking almost the entire time), but the overall school model and design was definitely interesting/thought-provoking/innovative/inspiring. 

Do you have any questions that you would like addressed for next week's Town Hall (should impact the entire organization)?

Nope.
