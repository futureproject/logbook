What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?

1) Finding a rhythm to balance TFP tasks and personal projects

2) Finding a better sleep rhythm

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

I think some more clarity for the Studio portion of National Learning Day would be helpful. Particularly with regard to how foundations are supposed to be integrated with concentrations during that time.

Did you complete the Integrity Survey? 

Yes. 

What thoughts did you have about "Most Likely to Succeed" after viewing it?

I think it's awesome the amount of freedom entrusted to the students and it was amazing to see how they responded to it. There seems to have been an incredible amount of growth in the highlighted students. It's exciting to see what space, opportunity, and creativity can do. 

My main, prevailing thought or question pertains to the process with which HTH  fulfills their yearlong projects. I'm just really curious about what a day to day looks like, what transpires over time, and how. 

Do you have any questions that you would like addressed for next week's Town Hall (should impact the entire organization)?
