Weekly Report (Due 8/28)

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 
-Getting AMEX money and making some of the year's first purchases! 
-Procuring a cheap fanny pack
-Creating, crafting and laminating some pretty things for my new space and the first day of school! 
-Refining the Be Brave vision with Liz from Landmark
-Getting a text from Nancy that says: "Looking forward to our culture of YES!"

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 
-Nancy was out this week, so that definitely puts some pressure on for next week's productivity (especially because it's a short week for me!)
- Not knowing the planned schedule at ALL for the first week of school!
- Not knowing how much PD time I'm being given before school starts!
- Still not convinced that an entire structured day for NLD is always the most powerful learning/creation experience. I know this will shift as school begins, but I think this week's session felt a bit unnecessary. 

Do you have friend or contact who is expecting follow up communication about a work opportunity with The Future Project? If so, what is their name, how you know them, and do you have any additional comments?

Yep, Sharan Bal. And Rob Friedman. Rob is a really close friend of mine. I saw Sharan recently and she said that she never heard back from us. 

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week? Any questions for the Town Hall?
