What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 

1. Sarah Zapiler's prep and incredible poise in our meeting with her new principal. (She really inspired me!)
2. The NY team's declaration of committing to determining the ways in we which we can leverage our opportunity of working with the largest public school system in the U.S. by creating policy and actually creating a paradigm shift.
3. Going to Tekserve with Shantrelle and opening an acct for TFP to ensure that we all get tax emption on our purchases.

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 

1. The studio session in the NLD felt more disruptive to the flow of work this week than productive. I know there was some testing occurring, but it made it a little tricky to be in the middle of a session and then have almost half the team step out for a separate activity. 
2. Learning about the change in process for ordering iPads for new DDs.  

Do you have friend or contact who is expecting follow up communication about a work opportunity with The Future Project? If so, what is their name, how you know them, and do you have any additional comments?



How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week? Any questions for the Town Hall?
