Weekly Report (Due 8/28)

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 
1)Meeting more of the staff at BCAM.
2)My meeting with principal where we set up a weekly check-ins and set time for me to present during the staff PD
3)Getting to see my classroom!!!!!!!!!!!!

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 
1) My principal and I disagree on the use of music on the first day.  So we agreed to move it to the first Friday. 
2) He also seems as though he doesn't fully understand what I am there to do.
3) Our differences about how the launch should/ could go forced me to re-think the plan.  Its still going to be great.  But the course correction this close makes me a bit uneasy.   

Do you have friend or contact who is expecting follow up communication about a work opportunity with The Future Project? If so, what is their name, how you know them, and do you have any additional comments?\
N/A

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week? Any questions for the Town Hall?
I have no questions for the Town Hall.  I have also already expressed my feedback on how the studio Google Hangouts could be more useful for me.
