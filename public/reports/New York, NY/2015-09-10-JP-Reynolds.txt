What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 

-Dream Photo Booth on the 1st Day of School!

-Performing for students during Extended Learning

-The Good Word Project has taken off well!

-Teachers wore the school buttons I got on the 1st day. 

-I've gotten to have a couple really powerful 1:1s. 

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 

-I went to P.D. the day before the 1st day of school and I should've definitely brought coffee and donuts and played music as teachers entered. The day was informative, but it didn't feel that powerful. I could have also volunteered to do an opening activity.

-I've got to get better at finding the balance for my role and communicate better when I need to be doing the work I'm here for.

-I think I'm being conflated with another CBO representative (who is AWESOME! by the way). Our partnership is good, and our roles are certainly collaborative, but there are some nuances between us. So ironing that out and getting that ball rolling will be good. For example, we ended up doing a coaching session together, but I don't know that our "goals" are exactly the same. Also 1:1 + 1 coaching can be awkward.  


Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared? 
-Is there an application already set up for us to give students interested in the Dream Team?
-What is the status of the MOUs?

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

Is it possible to upload photos to logbook from our phone? Also is there a logbook app for iPads? That may be more than 10% better, but it'd be dope to have that access!


A wellness check-up (Please answer each of the following questions): Are you getting "enough" sleep? Are you eating regularly? Are you spending quality time with your loved ones? Are you managing your finances well? Are you engaged in your emotional, spiritual, and/or physical practices regularly? Are you feeling intellectually and/or creatively stimulated?

-I am DEFINITELY not getting enough sleep.
-I am DEFINITELY not eating regularly.
-I am spending quality time with my wife. :)
-My wife is an incredible partner who is wise in the area of financial management, and her counsel has allowed me to answer this question in the affirmative. Loans are really rough though.
-My emotional and spiritual life are well. I need to do better making space for my physical practices.
-I may be intellectually and creatively OVERstimulated, which may inform my answers to the first two questions.  

Townhalls happen at 5:30PM on a Friday. If this time/day (or seeing the video afterward) isn't working for you and you were going to recommend another ideal day/time, when would you recommend we consider broadcasting?

Is there space for Townhalls to be a part of National Learning Day? 5:30PM on Friday is tough for me because I'm usually on the train at that time. I usually get home around 6:00pm. 

What is your principal's name?
