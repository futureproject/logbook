What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 
- My trip to Frank's school in New Haven.  This was my second year in a row going to help him out and it was great to see him repeat the same launch activity and estanblish a tradition.  Also, during the trip, since Ben (my NY Team accountability partner) & I were assigned to the same school we got to spend time bonding and seeing each other in some sort of action.
- Meeting with my Principal and getting a great sense of what we want to be up to for the coming year.
- Seeing how a school beautification project that I was an early facilitator and liason for with the Parent Association in the Fall of last year, has finally been put into action!!!

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 
Not applicable.  School hasn't started yet all things are BRIGHT.

Do you feel like you are on track to complete the Launch Sequence on October 1st (possibility audit and plan, personal possibility audit, promises and proof points)? If not, what would make a difference for you?
Yep.  I haven't gotten in school yet, so I haven't started working on it yet, however I have great communication with my Principal and school faculty and students so I see no trouble in completing it.

Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared?
Nope.

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?
No suggestions this week.
