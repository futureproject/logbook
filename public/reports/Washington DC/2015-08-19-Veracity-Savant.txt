What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights?

Some highlights this week included:
- Seeing my new office
I was so excited about my new office. Its a quarter of the size of my old office and I have to share it but its nestled away in a corner and super cute. There is natural light, and enough space for a couch so I'm excited. There's also very high, very bare, white walls which make my brain burst with possibilities!
- Finding Ms. Lee
I was excited this week to meet our new Director of Culture and Climate a.k.a. My New Best Friend b.k.a. The Greatest Thing To Ever Happen To This School, Ms. Lee. The only thing better than having allies in the school is having a person whose sole job is to be your ally. She's super cool and I feel like she gets it. We'll see how she fares once school starts and the oppressive powers start pushing but for now, I'll heir on the side of optimism.
- Facilitating the Integrity Workshop
I facilitated the Restoring Integrity workshop given to us by Sallome because I felt like the best thing to bring to professional development week was some personal development. It was really great to have all of the staff officially meet me and get a little glimpse of the type of work we do. 

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?
- One area to improve was having more time to prep between training and starting school. It was so hectic trying to prepare and I think that next year I'll be more mindful of the crunch time and TFP's invisible summer and just better prep and balance vacation and off time.
- I also would've liked to have more time to facilitate the workshop during PD. 30 minutes before it started, my principal went from allotting me 30 minutes to 15 minutes. Ughhhhh. Even though I made it work, I think it would be smart to begin collecting a plethora of short workshops that can be utilized for those moments.
- Another area to improve was in getting my office ready. I wish I would've found out my space earlier in the summer so I wouldn't have to run around last minute purchasing everything.


How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

Begin seriously considering how we can better incorporate self care time into the summer schedule in a way that accommodates each city depending upon their school start time.

Did you complete the Integrity Survey? No, but I will when I finish this.

What thoughts did you have about "Most Likely to Succeed" after viewing it?

I cannot believe that the school structure we're using is 100 years old! (Literal first thought)

Do you have any questions that you would like addressed for next week's Town Hall (should impact the entire organization)? Nope.
