What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights?

Bright spots and highlights this week are the following.
1. My chief director provided a great training this week in which is was perfectly inline with where I was in prepping for the school year. Each day the training provided better clarity for my up coming year as well as the next six weeks 
2. Meeting with my team after DD101 and DC Summit I was more secure in my understanding that I have something to contribute. 
3. I realized many connections between language and ideas for my dream team and up coming year. 
4. Though it was a struggle personally I was able to rise to the challenge and be involved in training. 
 5. By Friday I rose from a very dark place 

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?
1. This week was very rough personally. Outside of my work I was in a very low place.
2. Met with the superintendent Thursday and was disappointed that he didn't take time to read the report. I realize next time we need to provide this report in the event he hasn't read the first copy sent to him. 

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?
I am not really sure right now.

Did you complete the Integrity Survey? 
Yes

What thoughts did you have about "Most Likely to Succeed" after viewing it?
It was amazing. I am eager to work with my Chief Director to present a viewing to the parents and educators of our community. 

Do you have any questions that you would like addressed for next week's Town Hall (should impact the entire organization)?
Not at the moment
