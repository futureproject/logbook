What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 

- More Goal Setting Sessions for students this week. I have hit all enrolled students here at Riverside, save for about 3!
- There is a potential film project that my principal wants me and my students to work on. I am excited about it.
- I just arrangements with one of the administrators to pull all seniors who need volunteer hours every Friday @ 5th Period! They will be working on Future Projects for Volunteer hours!

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 

- My principal asking me to "seek additional funding" for her film project.
-Noticing that even with great attendance, and having hit every classroom, I only have 53 goal setting sheets...which says something about school enrollment!

Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared? 

- N/A

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

- 
N/A

A wellness check-up (Please answer each of the following questions): 
 Are you getting "enough" sleep? No
 Are you eating regularly? Yes
 Are you spending quality time with your loved ones? Yes
 Are you managing your finances well? I could do better.
 Are you engaged in your emotional, spiritual, and/or physical practices regularly? Yes. Recently got back on track.
 Are you feeling intellectually and/or creatively stimulated? I am working on it.

Townhalls happen at 5:30PM on a Friday. If this time/day (or seeing the video afterward) isn't working for you and you were going to recommend another ideal day/time, when would you recommend we consider broadcasting? - This time is rough for me. Maybe think of some way to include it into the NLDs!

What is your principal's name? - Wanda Gibbs
