Weekly Report (Due 8/21)

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 
1) Mapping out the next 6 weeks with True Haven Team
2) Getting a little clearer on the direction I want to move in this year - focus being on impact not so much on the "doing" of everything.

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?
1) Meeting with Superintendent. He had his poker face on, however I am clear that he appreciates the work we do, it was like he wanted to see us sweat a little bit. He also acknowledged that he didn't read our end of the year report - which led to him making unfound assumptions that had the team feeling a little annoyed. In terms of areas to improve, next time we need to come having all just read end of the year report we sent to him. 
2) I wasn't feeling well on Monday and I saw how this completely takes me off the court. In the future I may have to excuse myself, but I wanted to at least take in as much as I could - I just wasn't able to contribute a lot during the meeting.

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?
I can't think of anything at the moment.

Did you complete the Integrity Survey? 
Yes.

What thoughts did you have about "Most Likely to Succeed" after viewing it?
I haven't seen it yet. I was not at the meeting on Monday due to a previous commitment.

Do you have any questions that you would like addressed for next week's Town Hall (should impact the entire organization)?
Updates on Detroit (especially since a new article came out from Sherina that looks like a series of upcoming articles) and how the current team can be supported by us.
