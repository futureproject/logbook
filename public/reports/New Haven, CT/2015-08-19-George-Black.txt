Did you complete the Integrity Survey? 

-Yes

What thoughts did you have about "Most Likely to Succeed" after viewing it?

-Oh man, where do I start.I feel like that movie made so many good points, and I loved watching a school that operated on projects, as well as teachers who actually had faith in students ability to figure things out. I will say it seems that the students presented  were of a "certain caliber" of sorts, and that is to be discussed, but I loved the movie! I really think we need to carve out some time for we as a team to discuss that film!

Do you have any questions that you would like addressed for next week's Town Hall (should impact the entire organization)?

-Not at the moment, no!
