What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights?

1. My team & I did a six week planning exercise that enabled us to map out or execution form ow until Oct 1st, this was a very helpful forward planning activity.

2. I facilitated a day long experience at the university of new haven with my company Driven2Inspire, it was great, a serious of 5 workshops for freshman students. 

3.  Having the opportunity to view most likely to succeed with team true haven.

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve?

1. Having a meeting with team true haven and superintendent harries and finding out that he did not read our impact report. So he did not have a full context to what we did last school year. 

2. Feeling little behind this week in my first day plans, I know it will go off powerfully, but, monday and tuesday of next week will be very important that I execute on my list.

3. Those were my only two TFP rough spots for the week.


How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week?

We as an organization need to develop a risk management guide to dream directors specifically new DD's, I feel this should be included in our on boarding documents.

Did you complete the Integrity Survey? 

Yes I did  submit the integrity survey.

What thoughts did you have about "Most Likely to Succeed" after viewing it?

I was really blown  away by what I saw, I felt empowered to see this movie and felt like it was a manifestation of what a fully transformed future school could look like. It was a refreshing to hear the language  we use at TFP reflected . It really had me begin to look at a revaluate the way I look at the work I do as a dream director. 

Do you have any questions that you would like addressed for next week's Town Hall (should impact the entire organization)?

What role will the  Go Team have in producing  or co producing  city events??
