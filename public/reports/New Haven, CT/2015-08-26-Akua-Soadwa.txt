What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Bright Spots, or highlights? 
1) Meeting with Greg and Meredith - they were excited about my plan for the year! They are in alignment and I feel extremely confident and well about this year's plan and vision.
2) Reconnecting with a few staff members - I got to reconnect with Cynthia our Guidance Counselor.
3) Preparing for the Year - I just feel extremely prepared, even though my office space is not set-up!

What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 
None that I can think of.

Do you have friend or contact who is expecting follow up communication about a work opportunity with The Future Project? If so, what is their name, how you know them, and do you have any additional comments?
No.

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week? Any questions for the Town Hall?
Updates on Detroit would be great.
I reached out to Joseph already, so I know it is being handled, but when I try to access town hall from computer, I am told I need permission. It made accessing the town hall last week impossible.
