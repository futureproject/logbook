What 3-5 moments stood out this week as Pain Points, or areas to improve? 
The behaviors of some students at my school were really challenging so far this school year. Last week a kid was arrested. This week we had one student leave the school on a stretcher after threatening to shoot everyone in the head, followed by a student pulling the fire alarm. That led to a field trip being cancelled. Then on Friday, 20 minutes before school was let out there was a fight in the gym. 

Do you have any questions for the next Town Hall or any news that you'd want to be shared? 
No.

How can The Future Project as an organization be 10% better next week

A wellness check-up (Please answer each of the following questions): Are you getting "enough" sleep? Are you eating regularly? Are you spending quality time with your loved ones? Are you managing your finances well? Are you engaged in your emotional, spiritual, and/or physical practices regularly? Are you feeling intellectually and/or creatively stimulated?
Yes to all of the above.

Townhalls happen at 5:30PM on a Friday. If this time/day (or seeing the video afterward) isn't working for you and you were going to recommend another ideal day/time, when would you recommend we consider broadcasting?
I think a Tuesday or Wednesday night would be more ideal for me. Fridays at 5:30 are a little tough for me,

What is your principal's name?
